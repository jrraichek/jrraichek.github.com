     		<h2>St. Alphonsus Hall</h2>
        	 <p>A photojournalism piece exploring the abandon St. Alphonsus Hall in Boston Massachusetts. </p>
        	 <br>
        	 <p>St. Alphonsus Hall is part of the Mission Church Complex comprised of six buildings, two annexes and a boiler house. It was built in 1898, designed as “a clubhouse for the young men of the parish,” and included a library, recreation room, theater, and bowling alleys. The building has been unoccupied for over thirty years. </p>
			 <p>There were agreements to redevelop the Hall and two other buildings of the Mission Hill Complex. Weston Associates had also made a proposal for demolishing all three buildings and constructing 225 market-rate apartments in a 24 story tower. This led to community outrage for the refusal to examine preservation options. In the fall of 2001 Mayor Menino created the Mission Hill Citizens Advisory Committee to review and guide the redevelopment process. </p>
			 <p>The committee is not currently meeting.</p>

        	 <p>The most recent discussions for renovating the theater took place in 2002. The Mission Hill Citizens Advisory Committee is no longer meeting, and renovations are not moving forward. </p>
			 <p>A piece of history left to deteriorate, slowly caving in on itself. </p>
